# Generating a publishable API key
To create a token you must first authenticate your requests using a publishable API key generated by Rebilly.

## Adding a new key
Visit [Rebilly's page for adding API keys][1]{: target="_blank"}, and select *publishable* as the type for the key.

**Set as the publishable key**

Copy the key you created and use it with `setPublishableKey` to authenticate your requests. This command must run before the `createToken` method.

> See the `setPublishableKey` [method][goto-create].

```js
Rebilly.setPublishableKey('pk_live_...');
```



!!! warning "Deprecation of `setAuth`"
    In previous versions of the library the preferred method of authentication was to generate a private signature using a private API key and `Rebilly.setAuth`. This method has been deprecated in favor of publishable API keys.
